  <p class="info"> 	The events that unfolded at the 1968 Democratic National Convention were centered around the Vietnam War as well as the chaos surrounding the 1968 election cycle. The nation was in the height of the Vietnam war and multiple groups were protesting the continuation of the war. These tensions peaked at the Democratic National Convention on August 25, 1968. Leading into the events things seemed peaceful. Activists from MOBE and yippie camped outside of the convention. Hoping to supress protests, Mayor Daley approved only one permit to protest at the bandshell at Grant Park. About 10,000 protesters gathered outside the Democratic National Convention in Chicago to protest the Vietnam War. It didn't take long for this protest to turn violent.

<p class="info"> The above picture was shot by Leonard McCombe. This photo depicts the how large the protest was, as well as the division in the country with a clearly drawn line between the civilians and police. Photojournalism and the media depicted to the entire country how violent protests were becoming. Protesters were acting violently and police officers were responding with violence.

  <p class="info"> Photojournalism gave light to protests throughout the world involving civilians and police at this time. The American public was taken aback by the brutal retaliation by police and government officials and this could all be seen through the media's coverage. It showed Americans that police were not always protecting civilians and protestors, which was facilitated by photojournalists and mass media.

  <p class="info"> Looking at modern-day protests, such as in Ferguson, there is always a mass presence in media serving as a watchdog. This event marked the first time that there was contrversy over how an event was covered. People believed that some news stations sympathized too much with protesters and others were too haed on them. Up until this time, news was supposed to be neutral without partisan leans. The shocking images that came from Chicago laid the foundation for the cries of “liberal bias” that hound and undermine the mainstream news media. While there is no subsequent proof that this is the starting point, it could definitely be a point that created a divide in media coverage, leading to the differing opinions of networks such as Fox News and CNN.

<p class="info">On August 25 around 11:00 p.m., a couple thousand police officers wearing riot gear, helmets and gas masks lined up at Lincoln Park. Some threw tear gas into the crowd. Protesters fought back, and so did the police. Police beat protesters with Billy clubs to the point of knocking many unconscious.
