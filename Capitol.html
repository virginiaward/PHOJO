  <p class="info"> Five thousand women came together in Washington to protest the Vietnam War. Led by Jannette Rankin, these women marched from Union Station to the steps of the Capitol Building. When they got to the Capitol, they presented Peace petition to speaker of the House John McCormack. Rankin judged the overall effort a success, as it “scared the military enough to make them tell Johnson not to run again.” This became the largest march by women sinde the Women’s Suffrage Parade of 1913.

  <p class="info"> Photojournalism played an important role in this anti-war march through Washington because it was able to show how large scale the march was.

<p class="info">Protesters were outside the White House at all hours of the day carrying signs saying “Stop the War.” Chanting was so loud it could be heard from inside the White House. People were getting tired of the war because it started to seem like a war that couldn't be won.
