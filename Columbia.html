  <p class="info"> Students for a Democratic Society, a radical organization from University of Columbia, protested weapons research at the University of Columbia. Students said they would not attend a university that exploitted black people and developed weapons to kill them and the Vietnamese. The group wanted the university to unaffiliate itself with the Institute for Defense Analyses, a research group that worked with the Department of Defense. By the end of the uprising, more than 1,000 protestors took over five university buildings and the campus was put on lockdown after the dean was taken hostage. On April 30, more than 700 students were arrested, and over 100 were injured as a result of the protests. Historians compare these protests to modern social movements like the Parkland shooting or Black Lives Matter, with each group raising concerns about multiple issues.

  <p class="info"> Photojournalism played a role in this event because it helped to shed light on the events going on at Columbia University to protest the war. This protest did not end up on the front page of most papers but it was significant to show that as 1968 continued to move forward, protests are becoming more and more prominant.
