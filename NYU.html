  <p class="info">In an effort to keep Vietnam War relations off campus, nearly 500 New York University students and faculty protested against the school administration to keep Dow Chemical Company recruiters off campus. Dow chemical, a small company from Midland, Michigan, was originally recognized as the maker of Saran Wrap. Shortly after the Vietnam War began, the Pentagon gave Dow Chemical a bid to manufacture napalm for military contractors. Working for Dow became controversial when the chemical company became the sole supplier of Napalm for the United States. Dow Chemical Company atempted to recruit at NYU. Students rallied to protest after administrators did not accept their demands to keep recruiters off campus. Campus protests only raised publicity for the company, and in return, the number of interviews with college students increased. Photojournalists illustrated the unity among students in protesting the chemical company by capturing the large crowds on campus.
